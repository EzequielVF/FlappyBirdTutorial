This is an extension to the author's original project. Their video tutorial was used to understand the code and create a 
starting ground for the project. In this version I have added sound and images to the game.

####Running the game
In order to run the game, download the files and navigate to the directory where the bin folder is installed on your computer  
in a terminal. After you are inside the bin directory, type the command
> java flappybird.FlappyBird  
  
Use a left mouse click or the space bar to make the bird jump.
